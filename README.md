# RVNS-Website
## Capstone Proposal
### Create a functioning website for my mother's nail salon: River Oaks Nail & Spa
### She has requested it to have an appointment management system and product previews.  Product previews are simple enough, but I think the appointment system may require some things we haven't learned yet (or not, I would guess it's an API to make things easy).  That's all my mother's really told me about her requirement, but I would like to add some things.
### Perhaps a merchandise shop on the website.  This would require managing money, and you said we shouldn't use JS for money.  
### An account/login system.  I think this would need some form of security especially with passwords and even saved bank/credit card information should they choose to use the merchandise shop.
